## LED_Fade

### Description & Code
Description goes here

Here's how you make code look like code:

```C++
// set the brightness of pin 9:
  analogWrite(led, brightness);

  // change the brightness for next time through the loop:
  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
  if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;
  }
```
Talk about how the fade works, here....
